<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
  <div class="about-me-paragraph">
<p> Holistic thinker. Integrity. Friendly. <br />
Those are just a few words I would use to describe myself.
 I strongly believe in the idea of being a well-rounded individual.
  With the experience that I have accumulated from being a Receptionist, Digital Marketer,
  and Cleaner for Lay-Away B&B over the past 4 years, I adapt to key business principles
  such as putting customers first, solving problems, leading small teams  etc <br><br>
  Moreover, while my experience has afforded me a well-rounded skill set,
   I excel at:
   <ul>
     <li>Communivating effectively</li>
     <li>Time management</li>
     <li>Customer satisfaction</li>
   </ul> <br>
    just to name a few. I always do my assigned tasks with a pursuit of excellence whether big or small
     because I understand the impact each task has on the business as a whole. <br><br>
     I am a self-taught software developer and I enjoy taking on new challenges.
     I am creative as well as an analytical thinker and I really enjoy what I do.
